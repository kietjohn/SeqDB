{"name":"Seqdb","tagline":"A simple database for managing sequencing data","body":"SeqDB\r\n=====\r\nThis program simply parses through a list of .ABI files provided by the user, organize the files into a hierarchical structure, and insert the corresponding entries into a simple SQL database. \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n---------\r\n - organizing \r\n\r\n**Using the database**\r\n\r\n1. Copy/Move the sequence files into the Input folder.\r\n2. Click the \"Check Quality\" button to separate out the good and bad quality ones. Then click \"View Uncertains\" to see the files whose quality is inbetween good and bad. Judge if the sequence is *good enough* for giving meaningful BLASTn result. If yes, move it to the Good folder; if not, Bad folder.\r\n3. Input the information about the sequence files to the fields in Step 2, and check that the information are correct.\r\n4. Click the \"Import Files\" button. This will import the sequence files into the SQL database, create FASTA version of each sequence, and organize all the files into folders according to their Plate/Clone Alphabet. This will also produce a log file, which is equivalent to the transaction log on the interface.\r\n5. If there is any exception, click the \"View Exceptions\" button to view those files. If any exception file is a valid trace file, then use the manual input interface to add it into the database. Otherwise, the user should remove the file.\r\n\r\nNote: If there is any error during the import process, the error message is usually displayed in the command line window that accompanies the software window.\r\n\r\n**The database**\r\n\r\nThe database is an elementary SQLite database containing two tables, along with three views.\r\n\r\nThe first table is the Sequence table, which contains most of the information about the sequence files. The other table is the Blast table, which contains *only* the first result of the BLASTn search on the sequence.\r\n\r\nThe three views are: LowQuality, Rerun, and Pursue.\r\n\r\nSequence table\r\n------------------------\r\n<table>\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t<th>ID</th>\r\n\t<th>Plate</th>\r\n\t<th>Clone</th>\r\n\t<th>Primer</th>\r\n\t<th>Run_date</th>\r\n\t<th>Student</th>\r\n\t<th>Instructor</th>\r\n\t<th>Institution</th>\r\n\t<th>Quality</th>\r\n\t<th>FASTA</th>\r\n\t<th>ABI</th>\r\n\t<th>Pursue</th>\r\n\t<th>Comment</th>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n\t<tr>\r\n\t<td>2384</td>\r\n\t<td>2</td>\r\n\t<td>H5</td>\r\n\t<td>F</td>\r\n\t<td>2006-20-01</td>\r\n\t<td>NLA</td>\r\n\t<td>Bangera</td>\r\n\t<td>Bellevue College</td>\r\n\t<td>1</td>\r\n\t<td>Sequence Files/FASTA/PF002/H/Pf002_H5F_2006-20-01.fasta</td>\r\n\t<td>Sequence Files/ABI/PF002/H/Pf002_H5F_2006-20-01.abi</td>\r\n\t<td>0</td>\r\n\t<td></td>\r\n\t</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<dl>\r\n\t<dt>ID</dt>\r\n\t<dd>Unique identifier of the sequence in the database.

When the sequencing machine is left to run overnight, it is possible that two different sequencing in that same batch will have different run date. This is because the run date extracted from the sequence file is the date of *that* individual file. For instance, both sample A and B are loaded into the sequencing machine at the same time, but sample A is sequenced on 11:30 PM of 2010-10-23, sample B is sequenced on 1:05 AM of 2010-10-24, then they will have different run date.</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Student</dt>\r\n\t<dd>The student who performed the procedures to sequence the clone.</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Instructor</dt>\r\n\t<dd>The instructor who oversee the student.</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Institution</dt>\r\n\t<dd>The place where the sequencing was done.</dd>\r\n\t<dt>Quality</dt>\r\n\t<dd>How good the sequence is.
